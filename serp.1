.SH NAME
serp \- easily create (se)cure (r)edundant (p)ackages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B serp
\fI\,ACTION \/\fR[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR]... \fI\,DIRECTORY\/\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Serp is a CLI tool to simplify creation of compressed encrypted packages with
parity (data redundancy) information.
.PP
Serp is implemented as a POSIX compliant shell script that essentially is
a wrapper around following tools: tar (for packaging directory contents into
a single file), GPG (for compressing and encrypting the package), sha1sum
(for ensuring data integrity), PAR2 (for generating parity information).
.SH OPTIONS
An ACTION argument can be one of the following:
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-pack\fR
Pack DIRECTORY contents into single archive file.
Default archive file name is DIRECTORY.tar.gpg.
The archive file name can be changed using
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-name\fR argument.
.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-unpack\fR
Unpack contents of an archive into DIRECTORY.
By default look for archive file ./DIRECTORY.tar.gpg.
The archive file name can be changed using
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-name\fR argument.
.PP
An OPTION can be on of the following:
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-name\fR
Specify the name of the archive file
(default: DIRECTORY.tar.gpg).
The name must be supplied without file extension
(e.g. 'myfile', not 'myfile.tar.gpg').
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-redundancy\fR
Redundancy level in percents (default: 10).
This parameter is passed to par2 as\-is.
.TP
\fB\-X\fR, \fB\-\-delete\fR
Delete DIRECTORY after successful packing.
Note that directory is deleted simply with 'rm \fB\-rf\fR'
which does not securely destroy original (unencrypted)
data. To securely wipe data you can use tools such as
\&'shred'; however, be aware of its limitations on CoW
and journaled file systems (see man shred).
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Produce more verbose output.
.PP
Other arguments:
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Print version information and exit.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print usage information and exit.
.SH EXAMPLES
Pack ~/mydata directory into archive file myarchive.tar.gpg:
.IP
serp \-\-pack \-\-name myarchive ~/mydata
.PP
Unpack archive myarchive.tar.gpg into directory ~/mydata:
.IP
serp \-\-unpack \-\-name myarchive.tar.gpg ~/mydata
